## ðŸš€ Quick Start for Developers

### Prerequisites

```bash
Node.js >= 18.0.0
React Native CLI >= 12.0.0
Xcode >= 14.0
iOS Simulator >= 16.0
```

### Project Setup

```bash
# Create new React Native project
npx react-native@latest init VocabMasterApp --template react-native-template-typescript

# Install dependencies
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
npm install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated
npm install @tanstack/react-query
npm install expo-av expo-file-system

# iOS setup
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

### Backend Integration

The React Native app connects to the existing Express.js backend API running on `http://localhost:5000/api`.

Key endpoints include:

- `/vocabulary` - CRUD operations for vocabulary words
- `/vocabulary/daily-challenge` - Daily challenge system
- `/vocabulary/random/:count` - Random word selection
- `/azure-config` - Audio service configuration

## ðŸ“± Key Features Implementation

### Swipe Learning Interface

- Smooth gesture-based interactions using React Native Reanimated
- Fluid card animations with physics-based spring animations
- Visual feedback indicators for swipe directions
- Optimized for 60fps performance

### Audio System

- Azure Cognitive Services Text-to-Speech integration
- Intelligent caching system with AsyncStorage
- Support for multiple English accents (US/UK/AU)
- Offline playback capability for cached audio

### Spaced Repetition

- SM-2 algorithm implementation with custom modifications
- Difficulty-based interval adjustments
- Progress tracking and review scheduling
- Learning analytics and statistics

### Daily Challenge

- Deterministic word selection based on date
- Session persistence across app restarts
- Progress tracking with completion statistics
- Prevents multiple attempts per day
